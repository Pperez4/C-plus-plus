/* ------------------------------------------------------------
Write a program that calculates and displays 
a personâ€™s body mass index (BMI)

BMI = weight 703 / height ^ 2

where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in 
inches. The program should display a message indicating whether 
the person has optimal weight, is underweight, or is overweight. 

Optimal BMI is between 18.5 and 25
BMI less than 18.5, considered to be underweight
BMI greater than 25, considered to be overweight
