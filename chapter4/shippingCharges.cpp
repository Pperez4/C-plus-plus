/*-------------------------------------------------------------

The Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following 
rates:

Weight of Package (in Kilograms)      Rate per 500 Miles Shipped
2 kg or less                          $1.10
Over 2 kg but not more than 6 kg      $2.20
Over 6 kg but not more than 10 kg     $3.70
Over 10 kg but not more than 20 kg    $4.80


Write a program that asks for the weight of the package and the
distance it is to be shipped, and then displays the charges.
Input Validation: Do not accept values of 0 or less for the weight
of the package. Do not accept weights of more than 20 kg .
Do not accept distances of less than 10 miles or more than 
3,000 miles. These are the companyâ€™s minimum and maximum shipping 
distances.
