/* ------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that calculates and displays 
a personâ€™s body mass index (BMI)
BMI = weight 703 / height ^ 2

where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in 
inches. 
The program should display a message indicating whether 
the person has optimal weight, is underweight, or is overweight. 
* considered to be optimal BMI is between 18.5 and 25.
* BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered to be underweight.
* BMI greater than 25, the person is considered to be overweight.
